## Usage

To use the model:

1. Set the input parameters in `INPUT.txt` (Input description is given in `docs/Input.pdf`).
2. Set all material parameters in `Material_library` (Material parameters description is given in `docs/SMAHC_properties.pdf`).
3. Start `Main`.
4. Find output in `OUTPUT` separated in `Data_output` (State variables of SMA and SMAHC) and `Temperature_field` (2D temperature field of interlayer) (Output description is given in `docs/Output.pdf`).
